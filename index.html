	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
	I am originally from Topeka, Kansas, but it hasn't been "home" for quite some time.  In the past 13 years the majority of my life has been spent living, working, and going to school in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.  During my time in school I lived in both Berlin and Paris, and since that time I have lived in Berlin a second time as well as spending approximately a year and a half teaching English in Hangzhou, China.  I returned to Kansas in December '16 and will return to either Germany or China upon the completion of my coding program.  </p>

	<p>
	Two of my passions in life are traveling and photography.  During my time abroad I managed to visit 20 different countries and 50 major cities.  I can speak French and German with relative proficiency and I am working on learning more Chinese.  I started practicing my photography more after my study abroad program in 2011 and have loved it ever since.  I have advanced my skills through practice and perseverance and have won several awards for my work. </p>
